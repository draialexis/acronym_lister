# Acronym lister (docx â†’ python)

Want to extract acronyms from a `.docx` file? This'll do it

## How to use

You'll need `pip` and `python`

First install `docx2python`:
```shell
pip install docx2python
```

Then run it, passing as an argument the path to the file from which acronyms need to be extracted. 

From the root of the project, you can enter: 

```shell
python .\USAFREEDOM.py "path\to\file.docx"
```

## In the future

You'll be able to get a `.txt` file as output, instead of a list printed in command line
